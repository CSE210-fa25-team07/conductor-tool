**Sprint #:** 2

---

## Sprint Overview

### **Sprint Goal**
The primary goal of this sprint was to **implement functional features** for the Conductor app based on the technical roadmap established in Sprint 1. Specifically, the team aimed to:
1. **Complete stakeholder demo** with mostly complete frontend and mock data
2. **Build out core functionality** for each feature area (Auth, Directory, Attendance, Standup)
3. **Establish integration patterns** between features
4. **Refine codebase structure** for better maintainability and collaboration

---

### **Key Deliverables**
- Stakeholder presentation demo (completed November 13, 2025)
- Login and sign-up page implementation with Google OAuth
- Request access page for new users
- Attendance pages with calendar and meeting schedule
- Class Dashboard page with user/group profiles and directories
- Standup pages with team dashboard and individual history
- JSDoc documentation improvements

---

### **Outcome Summary**
The team successfully delivered the stakeholder demo and received **positive feedback from the professor**. All feature teams made **substantial progress** on their core functionality, transitioning from planning to implementation.

However, the sprint also revealed challenges with **feature integration**, **codebase structure consistency**, and **cross-team communication** that will need to be addressed in subsequent sprints.

---

## What Went Well

- **Strong progress across all teams:** All feature teams delivered substantial work and made meaningful contributions.
- **Positive stakeholder feedback:** The professor provided encouraging remarks about the team's progress and direction.
- **Feature team structure:** The decision to organize by features (rather than frontend/backend) enabled teams to truly reflect on and own their features.
- **GitHub workflow improvements:** The CI/CD setup and GitHub processes helped streamline collaboration.
- **Quality deliverables:** The results produced by all teams were visually appealing and functionally sound.

## What We Can Improve

### **Integration & Architecture**
- **Feature integration is unclear:** Multiple team members expressed concern that the way features will interact and integrate is not well-defined or obvious.
- **Integration points seem chaotic:** The connection between features appears disorganized and may lead to conflicts.
- **Codebase structure confusion:** The overall codebase structure needs better organization and consistency across teams.

### **Communication & Documentation**
- **Cross-team visibility is limited:** It's difficult to know what's happening in other teams, making integration planning challenging.
- **Documentation gaps:** The project lacks comprehensive documentation on how features should connect.
- **Hard to reach some team members:** Communication responsiveness varied across the team during this sprint.
- **Better issue and PR management needed:** Issues and pull requests need to be filled out more thoroughly and consistently.

### **Standards & Consistency**
- **Styling alignment concerns:** There's concern that styling inconsistencies will become problematic as features come together.
- **Codebase structure needs unification:** Teams should agree on and follow consistent patterns for structuring code.
- **Coding cohesiveness:** There's worry about whether code from different teams will integrate smoothly.
