# Pages

Page logic. One folder per team.

## Folders

- `auth/` - Auth team
- `directory/` - Directory team
- `attendance/` - Attendance team
- `standup/` - Standup team

## What Goes Here

Files that render pages and handle user interactions. Organize however you want within your team's folder.

Typical pattern:
- Import API functions
- Render HTML to page
- Handle events (clicks, form submits)
