# Sprint 3 — Infinite Loopers (#7)

**Date:** November 21, 2025  
**Team:** Infinite Loopers  
**Sprint #:** 3

---

## Sprint Overview

### **Sprint Goal**
To finalize repository structure, complete initial database setup, and begin integrating frontend, backend, and database components across all feature teams. Also begin planning for the new “code monitoring” feature pending clarification.

---

### **Key Deliverables**
- Repository restructuring completed and stabilized  
- Database created and schemas drafted across teams  
- Initial backend–frontend integration progress  
- Early UI planning and example pipelines  
- Exploration of code monitoring MVP  
- Documentation updates based on 11/20 repository review  

---

### **Outcome Summary**
The team aligned on current project progress and confirmed that Tanmay will provide a code freeze deadline (original launch target: **Dec. 5**).  
With the repository stabilized, teams resumed feature development.

Feature teams completed their database schemas and began frontend/backend integration planning. More detail is needed for **integration documentation** and the **code monitoring MVP**.

Repository structural decisions and updates were tracked in the shared doc from the **11/20 meeting**.

## What Went Well

- Database schemas created across all feature teams  
- Repository stabilized after major restructuring  
- Standup team delivered a working example end-to-end pipeline  
- Good alignment on backend/database architecture  
- Proactive documentation review and communication with Tanmay  
- Teams now unblocked for development  

---

## What We Can Improve

- Lost development time due to earlier repository instability  
- Need clearer documentation for UI ↔ backend integration  
- Code monitoring MVP requirements unclear  
- Architecture documentation and integration notes need expansion  
- Increased cross-team collaboration needed to reduce bugs  
- Missed mid-sprint check-ins due to restructuring

* Unusual Xerus: continuous changes to repo created delays in implementing features
* Fantastic Dolphin: Focusing to much on mini-features that are not core to the project with little time left.
* Imaginary Macaw: Confusing directions from the course staff (+2)
* Unusual Xerus: new code monitoring feature requirement added too late in project by course staff (+2)
* Zealous Yak: stupid AI policy lol (+2)
* Proud Wombat: Heavy workload from the course. No time on project

### Sad
* Imaginary Ferret: Finalizing the codebase took time
* Proud Wombat: Our progress was stuck at finalizing codebase which is time-consuming
* Unusual Xerus: wasn't able to work on feature this week due to repo changes
* Fantastic Dolphin: Little work done due to codebase issues
* Unusual Xerus: other deliverables like the technical knowledge sharing left less time for project

### Glad
* Optimistic Ferret: learnt a lot in the progress of working on the codebase.; 
* Unusual Xerus: database set up!
* Zealous Yak: codebase is finally all set
* Unusual Xerus: repo is now stable and we can start working
* Youthful Alligator: Submissions are over, and now i can work on the project more (+1)
