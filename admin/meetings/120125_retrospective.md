### **Key Deliverables**
- Integration of frontend and backend across all feature teams
- Testing of integrated features
- Code monitoring setup and planning
- Log ingestion implementation
- API-level metrics collection
- Final preparation for project delivery

### **Outcome Summary**
The team made good progress on feature integration despite heavy workloads from other courses during the final weeks of the quarter. With the project deadline approaching, teams are focusing on integrating features together and testing functionality. The team demonstrated strong collaboration and willingness to work together, with several members contributing during the Thanksgiving break.

Major challenges include managing the large codebase, frontend-backend integration complexity, and balancing project work with other course deadlines. The code monitoring feature requires additional planning and potentially extra support for integration.
